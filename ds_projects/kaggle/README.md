# KAGGLE PROJECTS

This folder contains projects based on Kaggle datasets. All datasets were sourced from Kaggle, and I conducted thorough analyses using them. These projects showcase my ability to work with real-world data, explore its structure, clean and preprocess it, and derive meaningful insights.

Each analysis demonstrates skills such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and application of machine learning models where applicable. The projects span various domains, reflecting a diverse set of challenges and methodologies tailored to the specific datasets. This folder serves as a portfolio of my work in tackling practical data problems using Kaggle's rich collection of datasets.
