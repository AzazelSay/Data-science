# DATA SCIENCE

**An open-source repository for Data Science enthusiasts to explore, learn, and apply techniques to address real-world challenges.**

A streamlined guide to kickstart your Data Science journey. Follow the outlined steps to answer the questions: "What is Data Science, and what should I learn to master it?"




This folder contains the projects I completed during the Machine Learning Open Course. 
Throughout the course, we explored various topics and applied them through practical tasks. 

We worked extensively with the Pandas library for data manipulation and preprocessing, gaining skills in handling large datasets efficiently. 
Additionally, we focused on data visualization techniques using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and insights in the data.

Our work included implementing and analyzing machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression. 
We covered both theoretical foundations and hands-on coding to understand how these models work, how to fine-tune them, and how to evaluate their performance. 
Other key areas included feature engineering, data normalization, and model validation techniques such as cross-validation.

This collection showcases a wide range of assignments, from basic exploratory data analysis to building and interpreting complex models, highlighting the practical application of machine learning concepts.
